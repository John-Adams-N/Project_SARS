## Introduction

**Project SARS** is an analytical pipeline designed to study SARS-CoV-2 mutation patterns in Kenya, focusing on **Alpha to Omicron variations**. This project integrates **genomic data processing, mutation pattern analysis, and machine learning-based classification** to understand mutation trends and their potential biological impact.

The pipeline leverages:

- **Biopython** for sequence handling 🧬
- **Nextclade API** for variant analysis 🔬
- **scikit-learn** for mutation classification 🤖
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization 📊

The findings from this analysis will contribute to epidemiological studies, vaccine effectiveness assessments, and public health policies.

## 📜 Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

## 🥼 Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

The first phase involves collecting SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from databases such as GISAID and NCBI and preparing them for mutation analysis. The steps include:

Fetching raw sequence data in FASTA format.
Running Nextclade to annotate mutations and classify variants.
Parsing and cleaning the mutation data for downstream analysis.
This phase is crucial in ensuring high-quality, well-structured genomic data before diving into computational modeling.

## 🧬 Phase 2: Mutation Analysis & Feature Engineering

Mutation analysis focuses on identifying patterns in SARS-CoV-2 variants, including:

Extracting nucleotide and amino acid mutations from Nextclade output.
Grouping mutations by variant classifications (e.g., Alpha, Delta, Omicron).
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect frequently occurring mutations and their impact on viral proteins.
By leveraging data visualization tools, we gain deeper insights into how SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time.

## 🤖 Phase 3: Machine Learning-Based Variant Classification

This phase utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their mutation profiles:

Feature selection from processed mutation datasets.
Training classification models using scikit-learn (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest).
Evaluating model accuracy with precision-recall and confusion matrices.
By building a robust classifier, we aim to predict high-risk mutations that may impact viral function and vaccine effectiveness.

## 📊 Phase 4: Visualization & Reporting

The final phase is dedicated to:

Generating visual reports on mutation frequency across different clades.
Creating interactive dashboards for epidemiological monitoring.
Summarizing key findings in a well-documented format.
These insights contribute to public health surveillance, vaccine adaptation strategies, and genomic epidemiology research.
